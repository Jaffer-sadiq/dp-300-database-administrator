# Lab 13: Deploy an automation runbook to automatically rebuild indexes

## Lab scenario
You have been hired as a Senior Database Administrator to help automate day to day operations of database administration. This automation is to help ensure that the databases for AdventureWorks continue to operate at peak performance as well as provide methods for alerting based on certain criteria. AdventureWorks utilizes SQL Server in both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings.

> **Note:** These exercises may ask you to copy and paste T-SQL code and makes use of existing SQL resources. Please verify that the code has been copied correctly, before executing the code.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create an Automation Account
- Task 2: Connect to an existing Azure SQL Database
- Task 3: Configure Automation Account assets
- Task 4: Create a PowerShell runbook
- Task 5: Create a schedule for a runbook

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes
