# Lab 06: Isolate performance problems through monitoring

## Lab scenario
The students will take the information gained in the lessons to scope out the deliverables for a digital transformation project within AdventureWorks. Examining the Azure portal as well as other tools, students will determine how to utilize tools to identify and resolve performance related issues.

You have been hired as a database administrator to identify performance related issues and provide viable solutions to resolve any issues found. You need to use the Azure portal to identify the performance issues and suggest methods to resolve them.

>**Note:** These exercises ask you to copy and paste T-SQL code. Please verify that the code has been copied correctly, before executing the code.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Review CPU utilization in Azure portal
- Task 2: Identify high CPU queries

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Task 1 - Review CPU utilization in Azure portal
  
1. From the Azure Portal, search for “SQL servers” in the search box at the top, then click **SQL servers** from the list of options.

1. In the left navigation, select **Query editor (preview)**.

    ![Screenshot showing selecting AdventureWorks](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img8.png)
   
1. In **Password**, type **P@ssw0rd01** and select **OK**.

     ![Screenshot showing selecting AdventureWorks](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img9.png)

1. In **Query 1**, type the following query, and select **Run**:

    ```sql
    DECLARE @Counter INT 
    SET @Counter=1
    WHILE ( @Counter <= 10000)
    BEGIN
        SELECT 
             RTRIM(a.Firstname) + ' ' + RTRIM(a.LastName)
            , b.AddressLine1
            , b.AddressLine2
            , RTRIM(b.City) + ', ' + RTRIM(b.StateProvince) + '  ' + RTRIM(b.PostalCode)
            , CountryRegion
            FROM SalesLT.Customer a
            INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress c 
                ON a.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
            RIGHT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.Address b
                ON b.AddressID = c.AddressID
        ORDER BY a.LastName ASC
        SET @Counter  = @Counter  + 1
    END
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing the Query](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img10.png)

1. Wait for the query to complete.

1. On the blade for the **AdventureWorksLT** database, select the **Metrics** icon on the **Monitoring** section.

    ![Screenshot showing selecting the Metrics icon](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img11.png)

1. Change the **Metric** menu option to reflect **CPU Percentage**, then select an **Aggregation** of **Avg**. This will display the average CPU Percentage for the given time frame.

    ![Screenshot showing CPU Percentage](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img12.png)

1. Observe the the CPU average across time. You may slightly different results. Alternatively, you can run the query multiple times to obtain a more substantial results.

### Task 2 -Identify high CPU queries

1. Locate the **Query Performance Insight** icon on the **Intelligent Performance** section of the blade for the **AdventureWorksLT** database.

    ![Screenshot showing the Query Performance Insight icon](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img14.png)

1. Select **Reset settings**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Reset settings option](../images/dp-300-lab-06-img15.png)

1. Click on the query in the grid below the graph. If you do not see a query, wait for 2 minutes and select **Refresh**.

    > **Note:** You may have different duration and query ID. If you see more than one query, click on each one to observe the results.

    ![Screenshot showing average aggregation](../images/dp-300-lab06-img16.png)

    For this query, you can see that the total duration was over a minute and that it ran approximately 10,000 times.
